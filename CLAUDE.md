Central control panel for gaming system optimization:
- **GamingModeController**: Toggle gaming optimizations on/off
- **GameProfileManager**: Create, load, and apply game-specific profiles  
- **QuickFixUtilities**: Common fixes for Steam, audio, GPU issues

### Gaming Monitor Suite (`gaming-monitor-suite.py`)
Real-time performance monitoring with gaming-specific metrics:
- **MetricsCollector**: Collects CPU, GPU, memory, disk, network metrics
- **TerminalDashboard**: Curses-based real-time monitoring interface
- Tracks gaming-specific data like GameMode status, Proton processes, compositor state

### Gaming Maintenance Suite (`gaming-maintenance-suite.sh`)
Automated benchmarking and system maintenance:
- CPU benchmarking with stress-ng and sysbench
