Hardware-specific optimizations for RTX 5080/i9-10850K/64GB RAM delivering 15-25% performance improvements through C-state tuning, ZRAM optimization, NVMe scheduling.

### Bazzite Hardware Troubleshooting Pattern
Hardware device failures (sound, network, USB) after optimization scripts often stem from audio system conflicts, not IRQ/core isolation issues. Root cause analysis workflow: examine PipeWire/PulseAudio socket conflicts â†’ systematic service cleanup â†’ proper daemon restarts â†’ verify device enumeration. Critical sections: IRQ affinity (lines 587-590), core isolation (lines 3512-3513), thermald disabling (lines 2909-2910), audio optimization (lines 3176-3225). Debug logging: change console_handler.setLevel(logging.INFO) to logging.DEBUG at line 1634. Pattern enables systematic hardware troubleshooting with proper service restoration.
